## About DinkyBot
DinkyBot is a custom Discord bot created for the Dinky Podcast community, written in [Python](https://www.python.org). Huge shout out to the crew over at [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) for making this easy and fun ‚ù§Ô∏è  <br><br> 
It's designed to add fun and utility to the Discord server. Right now it only has very basic functions such as posting GIFs related to community in-jokes, but my hope is that it can grow organically to serve the community. The sky is the limit!

Have an idea? Put in a [feature suggestion](https://github.com/leftydrummer/dinkybot/issues/new?template=feature_suggestion.yml)!

## Adding to Discord
The bot can be invited to be added to a server with the link below:
