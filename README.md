## About DinkyBot
DinkyBot is a custom Discord bot created for the Dinky Podcast community, written in [Python](https://www.python.org). Huge shout out to the crew over at [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) for making this easy and fun ❤️  <br><br> 
It's designed to add fun and utility(lol yeah right) to the Discord server.<br><br>
My hope is that it can grow organically to serve the community's needs. The sky is the limit!
