DINK YOURSELF!

## About DinkyBot

DinkyBot is a custom Discord bot created for the Dinky Podcast community, written in Python. <br><br> 
It's designed to add fun and utility (lol yeah right) to the Discord server. <br><br>
My hope is that it can grow organically to serve the community's needs. The sky is the limit!

## Slash Commands

User initiated commands that make the bot perform actions. All users can access by typing "/" followed by the command

- **/ping** - Responds with the bot's current latency
- **/hello** - Greets the user with a message in the format 'Hello, (user)!'
- **/weird** - Posts the "this is really weird" GIF.
- **/dy** - Shares the "DINK YOURSELF" GIF.

## Events

Things the bot does automatically in response to something occuring

- **On Ready** - Sends a "Hello World!" message when the bot comes online.

- **'This is weird' listener** - Automatically posts the 'this is weird' GIF when a message in a channel contains "this is weird" or "this is really weird".
